</p><p>When using ChatGPT, it is important to specify what date you want to use. Large
language Models such as ChatGPT give probabilistic output. The output differs
when given the same input. This is due to the way the data is encoded and the
algorithm used to extract the data, such as cosine similarity over a high-dimensional
space, which gives rise to hallucinations.
</p> 
<p>   A way of overcoming different outputs is possibly using conventional
programming techniques of caching and hashing the output; this could offer a speed
improvement and cost reduction over using ChatGPT. Using ChatGPT requires a
user to pay; however, you can use open-source language models such as LLama2, but
there will still be costs for hosting the models. Chatgpt gives free credit - but I think
you need to pay, so I need to wait til I have more money to investigate this. There
are open-source
</p> 
<p>   LLM are capable of reasoning; this can be demonstrated by asking a
math question without asking it to reason. It will show that it’s working
out and usually provides better results—referred to as Chain of Thought
Prompting. Better results can be achieved via few-shot learning; give the
model an example of what you are looking for. This can be achieved on
OpenAI’s Playground and through the chat log, where the conversation
between the user and assistant can be artificially created after ChatGPT.
Several more sophisticated ways of achieving this include context to large
language model through RAG. Using agent frameworks such as Langchain and
Autogen.

</p><p>I have recently been doing a Functional Skills English class, yes my English is
terrible, as it turned out, but I would like to point out that there was a fire alarm
during the test, so I am doing a level one qualification. Fun is it gives me more time
to enjoy learning about English.
</p> 
<p>   Interestingly, it’s noted that English aligns with first-order logic, documents
to be digested into knowledge graphs created via subject-predicate-object
triples, which comply with the RDF standard. SPO triples would be easy to
extract if natural language would be easy to extract, but we don’t talk in
simple noun-verb-adjectives, and the words often used are ambiguous and
vague.
</p> 
<p>   When ontological modelling OntoClean provides metrics such as identity, unity,
rigidity, and dependence, Welty and Andersen added two more meta-properties:
                                                                  

                                                                  
permanence and actuality. In semantic modelling, relational considerations such as
symmetry, inversion, and transitivity influence the structure of the knowledge
base
</p> 
<p>   Codd’s First Normal Form closely resembles RDF triples Codd’s algebra are the
selection, the projection, the Cartesian product (also called the cross product or cross
join), the set union, and the set difference. Appart

</p><p>While studying for my Master’s in Data Science, my tutor informed me that studying
without the foundations in the School of Engineering would be difficult. Therefore, I
have taken up studying Level 3 in Engineering. Previously, I studied Level 3 in
computing, moving on to a BSc in web technologies; this gave me a good
understanding of several data science techniques such as database programming and
animation. However, this did not prepare me to study data science at the School of
Engineering.
</p> 
<p>   Engineering is from the Greek to create, and that is what we have been doing in
this course using metalwork. I have been manually turning, milling and drilling to
create a tool maker clamp. For the first assignment of this module, I got a
distinction. Sadly, I only got a pass on the AutoCAD assignment because
when I completed the assignment, I made additional layers to check the
design and forgot to delete them. It was a pass, and now, we have passed the
deadline.
</p> 
<p>   I took the Engineering Principles exam this month, and I fooked it, but it’s best
out of two - I need to revise the conversions of energy and Archimedes principle and
provide answers in the correct units. A reoccurring exam question is about measuring
the gradients of a line, which is used in linear functions and creates a straight
line graph; having a good understanding of this was important too while
doing my Master’s and occurred during the Digital Image Processing exam,
which the function was used to identify lines in images. Indeed, to solve
many equations, transposing them into line equations allows a graph of a
problem.

<p>   This week, I have been off college as it’s a holiday before the new semester. I’m
looking forward to new classes and sharing what I learn.
