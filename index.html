thinking about the significance of Type theory, which is fundamental in programming
languages, type-safety prevents runtime errors ensuring numbers and strings don’t
mix during runtime which often causes programs to crash. Type Theory is
also essential in SMT (Satisfiability Modulo Theories) and SAT (Boolean
Satisfiability) solving, which are used in formal verification and proof assistants.
The Curry-Howard correspondence establishes a connection between logic
and computation giving a path towards high-assurance software. Formal
verification uses automatic proof procedures to ensure a computer program works
correctly.
</p> 
<p>   Boris Beizer, in his seminal work Software Testing Techniques (ITC Press 1990),
highlights that not testing a piece of code leaves a residue of bugs in the program
proportional to the size of the untested code. He states that logic errors and fuzzy
thinking are inversely proportional to the probability of the path’s execution.
But testing can only validate code against a set of concrete inputs, formal
proof can assure that the code is both secure and correct for all possible
inputs
</p> 
<p>   Earlier this year, Alphaproof by Google’s Deep Mind was used in the
International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) 2024 winning a silver medal using
techniques, such as reinforcement learning and neuro-symbolic learning. It is powered
by Lean, a proof-oriented programming language that allows for proofs involving
mathematical reasoning to be formally verified for correctness, its comprehensive
Mathlib package codifies math problems and how to solve them. The language is
powered by the calculus of constructs which differs from simple lambada calculus. It
supports dependent types, they depend on terms or values, for example, a type that
represents ”vectors of length n”, where n is a term, allowing specifications to be
written in the code.
</p> 
<p>   Statically typed programming languages like C, C#, Java and Rust produce
faster programs as the compiler does the checks during compilation, making checks
unnecessary during runtime, however, there are some exceptions such as arrays.
Dynamically typed programming languages such as JavaScript and Python do their
type checking during run time. A weak type system allows convention between types,
including languages like C and JavaScript. In a Strong typing system, different
types don’t mix, these include languages like Java and Rust. Programming
languages such as liquidHaskel and Liquid C enhance the expressiveness of their
type system by incorporating more complex types, such as refinement types
which use predicates for more precise type checking and to ensure stronger
guarantees.
</p> 
<p>   Racket uses the functional paradigm, which promotes pure functions and
immutability, facilitating Referential transparency and simplifying formal verification
and reasoning about code, making it easier to prove correctness. Program synthesis is
a cornerstone of AI, where logical reasoning can deduce the functions needed to
                                                                  

                                                                  
produce desired outputs. Rosette is a solver-aided programming language
that extends Racket. It allows users to write programs that mix concrete
code with specifications and uses solvers to generate programs that meet
those specifications. By using assertions specify the desired properties of the
program.
</p> 
<p>   In proof-oriented programming languages, assertions are an obligation to
detect and prevent errors by verifying that certain conditions hold during
execution. Most programming languages support assertions; they enable
Unit tests. It is recommended not to rely on them in production code for
exception handling, as they may be turned off in production environments.
Assertions can be made about metrics such as space and time complexity
using separation logic and linear logic to prove properties about resource
usage.
</p> 
<p>   Hoare logic, developed by C.A.R. Hoare in 1969, is the basis of many
automated program verification tools and techniques. A set of inference rules that
capture the semantics of different program constructs, such as assignments,
sequences, conditionals, and loops. By applying these rules, the verification of
individual statements is chained together to prove the correctness of the entire
program.
</p> 
<p>   The core of Hoare logic is the ”Hoare triple”: P C Q. Where P: is the precondition –
the program’s state before the code (C) executes.   C: represents the computation.  
Q: This is the post-condition – the program’s state after executing the computation.
Invariants are conditions that remain true throughout the execution of a program.
Similarly, in a presidency, some conditions might remain invariant during the
term. For instance, certain legal frameworks, constitutional limitations, or
demographic trends may not change. An invariant for a presidency might be:
”The country remains a democracy with peaceful transitions of power.”
</p> 
<p>   Backward reasoning starts with the post-condition working backwards through
the code to find the weakest precondition. It is suitable for finding the necessary
conditions for a program to achieve a specific goal, such as program synthesis and
identifying potential errors or missing conditions in the code. Forward reasoning
provides a structured way to analyze how a program transforms its initial state into
the final state. It detects errors confirming the program’s correctness by checking it
meets its specification for all possible inputs satisfying the precondition. To verify a
recursive function, the base case should be identified and a proof technique such as
mathematical or structural induction (which is best suited to graphs and
trees.
</p> 
<p>   Hoare logic is designed to reason over flowcharts and other systems, such as
business systems. In the mid-1950s, Grace Hooper developed FLOW-MATIC,
originally called B-0 (Business Language version 0), a precursor of COBOL, one of
the first high-level programming languages. The first person to write a compiler
David Wheeler of Cambridge University but this was for machine-specific “auto
code”. He was also the Ph.D. thesis adviser of Bjarne Stroustrup, the inventor of
C++.
</p> 
<p>   There were other high-level programming languages such as Lisp developed in
1958 by John McCarthy it was inspired by lambda calculus, it was run as an
                                                                  

                                                                  
interpreted language FORTRAN is considered the first high-level programming
language. John Backus led the development of FORTRAN, which allows
programmers to write complex mathematical computations in a human-readable
language merged (after the initial Fortran) was a notation for specifying grammars:
the Backus-Naur Form (BNF) later implemented in Algol60.
</p> 
<p>   There are various methods for proving the correctness of programs Bertrand
Meyer’s Design by Contract, developed in the 1980’s, implemented in the Eiffel
programming language which similarly uses preconditions, post-conditions, and
invariants referred to as class invariants. Racket also offers support through its
contract system, and major programming like C++, Java, Python and PHP, have
libraries and frameworks that can be used to implement DbC.
</p> 
<p>   De Bruijn Theorem highlights that writing informal proofs as formal
proofs is more time-consuming they significantly longer than their informal
counterparts—sometimes by a factor of four or more. This increased complexity
makes writing formal proofs more time-consuming and highlights the trade-off
between the rigour of formal verification and the practicality of software development
timelines. Rice’s theory recognises the limits of formal verification and static
analyses: any non-trivial semantic property of programs is undecidable. Specific
semantic properties and subroutines can still be verified, giving us powerful tools to
ensure correctness.
</p> 
<p>   Everest project brings together several research projects verifying protocols such
as TLS 1.2 and 1.3, and the automated prover Z3. They use F/* a formal verification
language therefore mathematically proving that their code satisfies certain properties,
such as memory safety, functional correctness, or security guarantees, with the
specification written within the code.
</p> 
<p>   Proving the correctness of a program involves writing a higher-order specification
in a language TLA+ (Temporal Logic of Actions) a formal specification language
based on set theory, first-order and temporal logic. TLA+ is used to model and
reason about concurrent and distributed systems, allowing developers to specify
system behaviours and verify correctness properties. Alloy is an alternative formal
specification language better suited for modelling structured programs and relational
databases. These methods are not exhustive as formal verification but do enusre the
the design is free from errors.
</p> 
<p>   What I find exciting about this is that it can be exported to WebAssembly which
can be used with other languages such as Rust and JavaScript that also
can be exported into WebAssembly creating a robust architecture. While
mathematical proofs provide strong assurances about code correctness, they
cannot fully encompass human factors such as usability, ethical considerations,
and user experience. formal verification with user-centered design. They
can facilitate technically sound building systems which provide a great user
experience.
</p> 
<p>   Computer programs often operate as subsystems across multiple dimensions and
timescales, involving complex, non-linear feedback loops that make them challenging
to fully understand. However, by reasoning over individual components, it’s possible
to prove the properties of the system as a whole. Using formal languages to define
and verify every aspect of a system may be excessive, but for critical elements—like
                                                                  

                                                                  
blockchain and cryptocurrency—it is essential.

<p>   Unfortunately, you cannot reason over a presidency as easily as a computer
program cos the effects of policies take time. Donald Trump as a person
has alleged to have done some deplorable acts, whereas Kamala Harris has
validated career in law and politics. Indeed this is not a recursive function of
Kamala Harris because she has only ever functioned as a Vice President. I like
her type its the hopeful type, the type of person I would like running the
country.
</p> 
<p>   Types often hang around together, it is well known that Donald Trump has had
conversations with Vladimir Putin, and Elon Musk has had conversations
with Putin. Perhaps they are making an evil network, but that’s yet to be
proven.
